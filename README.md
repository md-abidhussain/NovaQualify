## 1. Problem Description
Businesses spend hours qualifying customer leads manually through calls and emails, which slows sales and causes missed opportunities.Our project automates this process using conversational AI to save time and improve accuracy.

## 2. Proposed Solution
Our project, **NovaQualify**, is a React-based AI assistant that qualifies customer leads instantly using **Agora’s real-time voice and chat**.

Instead of manual calls, NovaQualify engages prospects in a natural conversation about their needs, budget, and timelines.Using Agora’s SDK, it captures live voice, converts it to text, and generates AI-driven responses for a human-like experience.The system then scores the lead and provides a summary to the sales team.

## 3. High-Fidelity Prototype
We have designed a complete, high-fidelity prototype that demonstrates the full user flow.
