## 1. Problem Description
[cite_start]Businesses spend hours qualifying customer leads manually through calls and emails, which slows sales and causes missed opportunities[cite: 29]. [cite_start]Our project automates this process using conversational AI to save time and improve accuracy[cite: 30].

## 2. Proposed Solution
[cite_start]Our project, **NovaQualify**, is a React-based AI assistant that qualifies customer leads instantly using **Agora’s real-time voice and chat**[cite: 32].

[cite_start]Instead of manual calls, NovaQualify engages prospects in a natural conversation about their needs, budget, and timelines[cite: 33]. [cite_start]Using Agora’s SDK, it captures live voice, converts it to text, and generates AI-driven responses for a human-like experience[cite: 34]. [cite_start]The system then scores the lead and provides a summary to the sales team[cite: 35].

## 3. High-Fidelity Prototype
We have designed a complete, high-fidelity prototype that demonstrates the full user flow.
